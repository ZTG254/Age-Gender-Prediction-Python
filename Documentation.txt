Overview:
This code detects faces in an image and predicts the age and gender of each detected face. It uses pre-trained deep learning models provided by OpenCV for face detection, and Caffe models for age and gender prediction.
The images are stored in the faces folder and their output in the outputs folder.


Dependencies:
    OpenCV (cv2)
    Pre-trained models for face detection, age prediction, and gender prediction.

pip install opencv-python

Models:
    Face Detection: Uses opencv_face_detector_uint8.pb and opencv_face_detector.pbtxt.
    Age Prediction: Uses age_net.caffemodel and age_deploy.prototxt.
    Gender Prediction: Uses gender_net.caffemodel and gender_deploy.prototxt.

Constants:
    MODEL_MEAN_VALUES: Mean values used for preprocessing the age and gender prediction models.
    age_list: List of age ranges corresponding to the outputs of the age prediction model.
    gender_list: List of genders corresponding to the outputs of the gender prediction model.

Functions
load_image(image_path):
    Description: Loads an image from the specified path.
    Parameters:
        image_path (str): Path to the input image.
    Returns: Loaded image in BGR format.
    Prints: Error message if the image cannot be read.

detect_age_gender(image_path, output_path):
    Description: Detects faces in an image, predicts the age and gender for each detected face, and saves the result with annotated age and gender.
    Parameters:
        image_path (str): Path to the input image.
        output_path (str): Path to save the output image with annotations.
